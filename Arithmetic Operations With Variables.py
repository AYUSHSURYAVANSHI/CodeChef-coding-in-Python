#Solution as follows
s = 10
areas = s*s

l = 25
b = 17
arear = l*b

#In this example, area of rectangle is higher than the area of the square
areadiff = arear - areas
costs = areas * 4

print("The area of Square is", areas )
print("The area of Rectangle is",  arear )
print("The difference of areas is", areadiff)
print("Cost of painting the Square is", costs)
